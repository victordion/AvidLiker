Life is short. How can I make smart use of my time to express my respect to people I follow on Twitter promptly without making myself exhausted?
This script helps you login into your Twitter account, and click the favorite button on tweets that appear on your timeline. Sounds wonderful huh?
## Usage
It is pretty straight forward. Fill in your login email in the script, then type
```
% python login_twitter.py
```
Type in your password, and you will see output such as
```
Login OK

Of course you will need to install some dependency packages first. If you have some prioror experience working with web scraping, this will not be a problem for you.

## Disclaimer
You can use or modify the code in anyway you want. Just don't be too aggresive or you may get blocked by Twitter. Be a good internet citizen.
